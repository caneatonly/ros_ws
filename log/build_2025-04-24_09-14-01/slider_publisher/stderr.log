[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrqt_gui_py.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "rqt_gui_py", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "rqt_gui_py" with
  any of the following names:

    rqt_gui_pyConfig.cmake
    rqt_gui_py-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "rqt_gui_py" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "rqt_gui_py_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "rqt_gui_py" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
